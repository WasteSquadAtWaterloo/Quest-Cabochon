# WasteRPG
## WORK IN PROGRESS, TEST [HERE](https://wastesquadatwaterloo.github.io/WasteRPG/)
###Controls:
* WASD or Arrow Keys to move
* Click in a direction for a melee attack
* C to toggle inventory
* E to use health potion (If available)
* Q to use mana potion (If available)
* Space Bar to shoot a magic attack in the direction of the mouse pointer

Walking close to NPCs will active their abilities (dialogue, healing, or shop interface). Walking over items will pick them up and place them in the player inventory. Click on items in the inventory screen will "use" them (e.g. Equiping armor, using potions, equiping weapons). 

###Known Issues to be addressed:
* Lag when moving around active projectiles
* Final boss battle not implemented
* ~~Unequiping items in the inventory does not remove them from the actual game sprite; however, equiping another item of the same class (helmets/chestplates/weapons) will replace the existing item.~~
* ~~Mobs respawn with messed up health bars (The health bars do not decrease when the mobs take damage)~~
* ~~Unequiping and re-equiping armor will end up compounding the armor's protection stats~~
* ~~Equiping/unequiping armor when dead will make the character stand up~~
* ~~Dying in a map other than map_0 and respawning causes NPCs to load incorrectly~~
* ~~Performing a melee attack will make performing a spell attack impossible until the player moves~~
* Dying instantly when loading back into the main map?
* Walking through trees (left in for testing purposes)
* Buying items from the store does not take away from the player's coins (left in for testing purposes)
* Crazy fast mana regeneration (left in for testing purposes)
